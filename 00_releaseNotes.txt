FighterPilot 2 Release Notes.
=============================
FP2r0-01012016:
First Release, or at least where I'm stopping for a while.
Features:
	A Working Fighterpilot Game. Shoot Away.
	Multiple types of Enemies.
	Random Level Generation.
	Determination(note really).
What should be looked for in the next release:
	More Enemies.
	Items and Effects.
	More Players?
	Better Level Generation.
		Saving Levels to a file.
	Blocks will be used.
	
I'm stopping development on this project for a while. I may pick it back up in the future.
In it's current state, it plays, functions and looks better than the original ever could have.
My original goal of remaking the game so that it can be easily extended has been completed.
I will eventually finish the game.
