Console Commands:
=================

A Console Command allows for easy debugging and implementation of other features within the game.

The first iteration of the console will be in the actual console, where the program is started.

When the console is started, it will call on a command defined in a startCommand variable.

I want to have the command system to be modular, so that there is no list that needs to be updated, but simply just a way to access the command just by the name (Class.forName()?)

The user will enter text containing the Command name, and arguments.

---

Each command should implement a Command Inerface and should be housed in a different class.
These classes will then be added to a Map using the COMMAND NAME as the key and the actual command class as the Command name.


---
The Commands will be housed as follows: 

package terminalInterface:
[Console Class<where the terminal interface starts>]

[Command<Parent class of the Terminal commands>]
	[<Commands>...]
	[Help --> prints all possible commands along with breif description of what they do]
	[Title --> prints out the FighterPilot2 Logo in Ascii characters]
	[Command: --> changes command settings.]
	[...Other Commands...]
	
...
<in the root directory>
{TextFile: commands.lst --> Has a list of the fully Qualified Class names that implement commands. Command class loads this at startup.}

---
Each command class can have multiple commands, the list of commands will be propagated from all classes that implement the Command Interface, using a method.
