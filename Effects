Effects : Stats
===============

Effects affect stats over a given period of time, and are essentially StatsItems that can affect the stats of a given GameObject.

Effects work in three modes: Add, Multiply and Replace (as well as Subtract and divide, respectively)

Effects will be added to a GameObject's currentEffectList if an effect is applied to an object.

Effects have a DURATION during which an effect will be active

Modes:
	Replace
		-This will replace a given stat for the duration and restore the old value at the end
	Add
		-This will add something to a given stat each time the duration is updated
	Multiply
		-This will multiply a given stat by something each time the duration is updated
		
Implementation in a GameObject:

The Sprite will handle the adjusting of Stats by use of a method to go through all effects and adjust the respective stats accordingly.

However, if Stats were to have methods to allow Effects to change Stats, that might make implementation easier, however having the methods to do that might affect the way I want the program to work
