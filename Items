Items:
======

There will be three types of items: those that affect Stats, those that spawn in something, and those that affect the level.

Item Types: Affect Stats, Spawning, Affect Level (LevelEvent)

Items that affect Stats:
------------------------

These items will affect stats of another GameObject that also implements Stats.

These Items are Generic, meaning that all Items will have the stats, name, etc. entered into the Item Constructor in order to create the object.

Example: Item("Item Name", 10,10,0,0,0,0,0). Pretty simple, and should also help reduce the amount of times that the game must be recompiled, and also should help prevent the need for a huge Java enum full of all items present in the game.

This will make implementation easier.

----------------------------
Items that Spawn in Sprites:
----------------------------

These items will spawn in another sprite.

These items, like Stats Items, are Generic, so the GameObject to be spawned in will be part of the Constructor.

Example: Item<GameObject>("Item Name")

----------------------------
Items that Affect Global Level(LevelEvent)
----------------------------
These Items give a GameEvent. This will be implemented in the future, since I have not yet implemented GameEvent.


---------
Interface Inventory
---------

This gives a GameObject an Inventory

----------
Generic Item Abstract Class (Since there is no true "generic" item)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

All items have a weight, name and ID.

----------
Inventory:

All inventories are extended from the Inventory abstract class

There are a few types of inventory limits:	weight
											amount of item types
											amount of actual items
