Saving Objects that are not Blocks or Sprites using VarLists
============================================================

For Game Objects that are not Sprites or Blocks, the individual variables will be saved using formatted String with the variables.

Example using Enemy:

Enemy{ loc{x = 0.0, y = 0.0} ... speed = 0.001, coolDown = 1000}

The above String will then be fed into the sprite using the "buildObject" method : buildObject(<formatted variable list>).

The object will then build itself using this code, setting the other variables to the proper settings.

Have separate VarList Class?

Also, it may help to have an interpreter for each interface that can be used by a GameObject, in addition to the VarList
