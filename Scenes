CutScenes:
==========

Cutscenes will be used to play animations among other things. These cutscenes will mainly be animations, not character sprites set on a level background.

These cutscenes will make use of the Messager System as well as graphics, not necessarily the level format, though I guess it could be used.

The Cutscene will be seperated into Cutscene Events that happen after a given amount of time. Cutscenes will draw stuff to the screen through the use of a method which takes in the Graphics2D object and then does whatever it needs to.

In a nutshell, Scenes can be used as fancy backgrounds and other things which would involve a lot of drawing
